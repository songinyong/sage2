V2.0.0
------------
- Up version to 2.0. [Luc Renambot]
- Modified upper/lower bounds on auto UI scaling Added mesaverde config
  with auto scaling. [Arthur Nishimoto]
- Merge branch 'master' of https://bitbucket.org/sage2/sage2.
  [AndrewTBurks]
- Initialize pointer color with hex value (instead of array) [Luc
  Renambot]
- Update pointer color and name into server when UI connects. [Luc
  Renambot]
- Added possibility for multiple users to create partitions at the same
  time (previously only 1 user could concurrently drag a partition,
  error from only testing with 1 user). Also, instead of parse error
  creating color on display, if hex string is invalid, default to
  (200,200,200). [AndrewTBurks]
- Check when click in background UI that app exists. [Luc Renambot]
- Merge branch 'master' of https://bitbucket.org/sage2/sage2. [d-k-k]
- Merge branch 'master' of https://bitbucket.org/sage2/sage2.
  [AndrewTBurks]
- Appveyor.yml. [Luc Renambot]
- Fixed scaling of apps which are not resizeMode: free when partitions
  are resized. [AndrewTBurks]
- Removing image doodle converter until edit speed is improved. [d-k-k]
- Movie player sync with play, pause, stop, seek. Only the commands set
  the sync time. Currently an observed that they still not not change at
  exactly the same time. Stop is due to frame being processed while stop
  command is sent. Added step by framerate. [d-k-k]
- Changing menu order in file manager ui. [Luc Renambot]
- Making sure partition field exists when loading sessions. [Luc
  Renambot]
- Appveyor.yml. [Luc Renambot]
- Merge branch 'master' into Andrew-Branch. [Luc Renambot]
- Appveyor.yml. [Luc Renambot]
- Get ffmpeg binaries from our local bitbucket mirror. [Luc Renambot]
- Fixed comments in code from previous commit. [AndrewTBurks]
- Integrated partitions into auto_hide behavior, completely hiding the
  partition structure on the wall. Also, fixed app shifting when inside
  partitions, keeping them within the original boundary, as opposed to
  shifting/scaling up and ignoring title bars. [AndrewTBurks]
- Merge branch 'master' into Andrew-Branch. [AndrewTBurks]
- Merge branch 'master' of bitbucket.org:sage2/sage2. [Luc Renambot]

  Renambot]
- Optimizing photo slideshow. [Luc Renambot]
- Putting error handler in readStream. [Luc Renambot]
- Added sound manager for 'traoumad' [Luc Renambot]
- After sabi retrives config file, removes info div about fetching. Also
  saving no longer automatically generates keys. Another button made.
  Reason: auto making keys causes problems with machines using a CA
  given cert. [d-k-k]
- Updates to mouse event passing. Changed the way events were generated
  to get around the read only attributes and autofill nature of certain
  properties that become incorrect due to SAGE2 app location. [d-k-k]
- Appveyor.yml. [Luc Renambot]
- Small fix (hopefully fixed) to maximization behavior of app in
  partition. Added Delete All Partitions and Assign Content To
  Partitions buttons in Partition menu in File Manager. [AndrewTBurks]
- Added partition area indicators to webUI. The representation may want
  to be scaled down so it stands out less, not sure right now.
  [AndrewTBurks]
- Fixed display-side title bar calculation (wasn't correctly using
  ui.titleBarHeight). Also, made colors for preset partition layouts
  less random (now using a colorbrewer set of 12 colors). [AndrewTBurks]
- Merge branch 'master' into Andrew-Branch. [AndrewTBurks]
- Forgot to switch out sage2_on file. [d-k-k]
- Merge branch 'master' of https://bitbucket.org/sage2/sage2. [d-k-k]
- Finally have sabi working better. Might still be bugs, but all major
  ones are found. Code was mainly additive. Cleanup will be done later.
  [d-k-k]
- When a static layout of partitions is loaded, the partitions get
  random colors in order to better distingush different areas.
  [AndrewTBurks]
- Revamped object structure for defining a partition layout. Draws from
  bootstrap.js ideas (12 units of space to allocate for each row and
  column). Allows for much more customizable layouts, and possibly even
  a layout wizard to make layouts? [AndrewTBurks]
- Added corner-dragging functionality for partitions. Also, drag corner
  changes visibility when hovered. [AndrewTBurks]
- Fixed problem with maximization toggle of applications in tiled
  partition, now maximizes and tiles in the correct order.
  [AndrewTBurks]
- Partitions loading and grabbing existing apps as well as apps in
  session correctly. Some layout problems if partition needs to re-
  layout apps because of an existing app. [AndrewTBurks]
- Partitions are saved into session, and loaded on session load. Having
  problems reassociating apps with partitions at the moment.
  [AndrewTBurks]

  node-partition.js file. Partitions can have a innerMaximization state
  now, along with the innerTiling state. More explanations and image in
  comment of commit. [AndrewTBurks]
- When apps are moved into, out of, or within a tiled partition, the
  tiling of that partition will be updated. Also, partitions are now re-

  apps maximized within a partition can still move freely (instead of
  being locked in one dimension in partition. [AndrewTBurks]

  highlighted. [AndrewTBurks]

- Children move with parent partition when parent is moved. CTRL and
  drag with left mouse to create a new partition (still buggy). Movement
  of partiton added but disabled (moving the partition causes it to get
  stuck to the cursor, not detecting release when moving the partition.
  [AndrewTBurks]
- Merge branch 'master' into Andrew-Branch. [AndrewTBurks]
- Fix parsing width and heigh of SVG files (some have a unit specified)

  [Luc Renambot]
- Added more maximize/restore functionality. If window aspect ratio is
  wider than screen, window locks to sides and can only translate
  vertically. SHIFT + Maximize on resizeMode = 'free' window will
  maximize the window to fill the whole screen. SHIFT + Restore will
  restore window to native height/width. [AndrewTBurks]
- Modified maximize item and move item functionality so windows become
  maximized in the same area of the screen as they start in, as opposed
  to in the center. To make moving these maximized windows through the
  screen easier, maximized windows stay aligned relative to top of
  screen. Also, when restoring a maximized window which has moved, it
  restores relative to the new center of mass of the window.
